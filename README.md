# My web application portfolio with React

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description

Welcome to my web application portfolio, which has been created using React among other web development technologies and tools.

This was part of a project to showcase my skills using React while also having a place to put a spotlight on some of the web applications I have developed over the last six months.

## User story

```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance criteria

```
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer
WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required
WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies
WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)
```

## Technologies used/built with

This project used the following technologies to build it:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repo (HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/CharDige/CharDige-react-portfolio.git` or SSH: `git clone git@github.com:CharDige/CharDige-react-portfolio.git`)

2. Install all NPM packages by running `npm i` in the command-line. **Note:** This may take a while as it will be installing the npm packages to build a React app. You can also install each npm package individually:

- `npm install bootstrap`
- `npm install bootstrap-icons`

> If you want to set up a React app first, you can read instructions on how to do this here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

## Usage

Below, you will find a GIF showing my web application using React.
